## Tech Track 3 - The Communist AI

Download the [corpus8k.wav](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7ED5AY6wP1CcjR4U2pYTVlaOTg/view?usp=sharing) to the `corpus` directory. You only need it if you want to try training the network.
Note that training the network takes weeks, but you can try it anyhow.

The pre-trained model was trained on 48 kHz corpus.

If you want the better quality corpus, in 48k sample rate, there is [corpus.wav](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7ED5AY6wP1Cd1prV0N6SGhxZ0E/view?usp=sharing) also. Note that training that requires several months.
It's also quite large, almost 1 GB.

The `corpus` directory contains two files (after you downloaded the `corpus.wav`):

 * `corpus8k.wav`: approximately 1.5 hours of Communist music concatenated to a single channel 8 kHz WAV file.
 * `test8k.wav`: A Communist music piece not included in the corpus for use as a test example.

Validation set is skipped, as the real validation happens in generating sounds with the system.

## Caveat

Training such large models will take 1-2 months using decent consumer grade hardware. Because of this, we weren't
able to have a very well trained final model, but we will have some model that probably leans towards Leninism a bit
even though it is not yet completely brainwashed yet.

Joking aside, the technical side in training these models is that the model learns a decent prediction model
pretty fast and gets decent loss values and 1-step forward outputs for training inputs. However, the network
has a lot of uncertainty at occasional situations leading to snapping sounds in generation. That is because
the model output gives a somewhat uniform distribution of amplitude values when uncertain. Sometimes these
lead to snaps when in generation a somewhat improbable outlier is selected.

Additionally in generation is is important that the model has totally saturated its internal representation
probability distributions so that it does not have large volumes of value space dedicated to situations that
do not match training data. This is because in generation the uncertainty accumulates quickly, and a small
divergence in the generated output that is not exactly something seen in the training data is not generalized
well by the model when fed back to the input, causing internal representations in non-training space volume,
and this causes noise in the output, because the output neurons haven't seen such internal representations in
training and their respective output is pretty much undefined. So, for not completely trained models
the generated output is colored noise that has some amplitude envelope structure.

After about 2 weeks of training on an i5-4690 CPU @ 3.50GHz with 24 GB of memory (Note that the model is too large
for any consumer grade GPU system) we got something like this: [generated.wav](https://github.com/cybercom-finland/hacking-great-3/raw/master/t3-communist-ai/samples/generated.wav). Possibly before the event the quality is a bit better, but not much.

### Training

You can well skip this step, as it takes a really long time (months) to properly train this kind of model. But you can kind of try it out and see where it is going.
Intermediate results are interesting to look at and play with also, even if they are very noisy. Not fully trained models cannot be used very effectively for generating
waveforms, as the results are pretty much noise.

The repository will contain a pre-trained model (TODO), so you can skip this step.

### Generating Wave Forms

The waveforms are generated by feeding the trained model a seed wave. The system then tries to predict the next sample, or more accurately it predicts the discrete distribution
in 256-valued µ-law encoding for the next sample. The system then picks a value from this predicted distribution, and it is added to the end of the seed wave.
Then this is repeated, and the system generates a sound wave based on the initial seed.

It takes a long time (several hours or so) to get reasonably long wave forms, but intermediate results can be interesting to look at.

The repository will contain a set of pre-generated waveforms for different seed signals (TODO), so you can skip this step.
