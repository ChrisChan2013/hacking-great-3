## Tech Track 3 - The Communist AI

The `corpus` directory contains two files:
- `corpus.wav`: approximately 1.5 hours of Communist music concatenated to a single channel 48 kHz WAV file.
- `test.wav`: A Communist music piece not included in the corpus for use as a test example.

Validation set is skipped, as the real validation happens in generating sounds with the system.

## Compulsory Copyright Notice
All sound content belongs to their respective copyright holders. The concatenated WAV file is meant for academic research / teaching only on the basis or respective
[copyright exceptions in the Finnish copyright law](http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/ajantasa/1961/19610404#L2P14), American fair use and also noting that the property of a Communist is common.
