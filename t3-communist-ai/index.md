## Tech Track 3 - The Communist AI

Download the [corpus.wav](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7ED5AY6wP1Cd1prV0N6SGhxZ0E/view?usp=sharing) to the `corpus` directory.
It's quite large, almost 1 GB. You only need it if you want to try training the network.

The `corpus` directory contains two files (after you downloaded the `corpus.wav`):

 * `corpus.wav`: approximately 1.5 hours of Communist music concatenated to a single channel 48 kHz WAV file.
 * `test.wav`: A Communist music piece not included in the corpus for use as a test example.

Validation set is skipped, as the real validation happens in generating sounds with the system.

### Training

You can well skip this step, as it takes a really long time (days) to properly train this kind of model. But you can kind of try it out and see where it is going.
Intermediate results are interesting to look at and play with also, even if they are very noisy. Not fully trained models cannot be used very effectively for generating
waveforms, as the results are pretty much noise.

The repository will contain a pre-trained model (TODO), so you can skip this step.

### Generating Wave Forms

The waveforms are generated by feeding the trained model a seed wave. The system then tries to predict the next sample, or more accurately it predicts the discrete distribution
in 256-valued µ-law encoding for the next sample. The system then picks a value from this predicted distribution, and it is added to the end of the seed wave.
Then this is repeated, and the system generates a sound wave based on the initial seed.

It takes a long time (several hours or so) to get reasonably long wave forms, but intermediate results can be interesting to look at.

The repository will contain a set of pre-generated waveforms for different seed signals (TODO), so you can skip this step.
