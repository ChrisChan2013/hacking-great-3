### Running code in Local Docker

Requirements

- Docker
- Linux or Mac for the scripts

To run the application in local docker container use

    sh local.sh build
    sh local.sh up

and browse to <http://localhost:8080>

If you do a change you need to tear the container up and down.

    sh local.sh build
    sh local.sh down
    sh local.sh up
